## Objectives
* Create a machine learning model which can accurately identify a picture as being one of ten animals.
  - The ten animals consists of butterfly, cat, chicken, cow, dog, elephant, horse, sheep, spider, and squirrel.
* Design a website that showcases our findings for images utilized to run through our model.
* Understand the levels of accuracy for our model and quantify it.</p>

## Resources
* Datasets:

## Training Model
* Intially utilized Cloudinary to convert image data to 32x32 pixels.
* Uploaded and stored on MongoDb for later training.
* Keras was utilized to train the model using the RGB and pixel data for the individual images in the dataset.
* Used TensorFlow to build the model to classify images.
